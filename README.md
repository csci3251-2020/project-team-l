# Introduction  
Here is a short summary of things our team will do.

To begin, we need to start issues, create a project board and set up readme.md.

When the readme.md is ready, we need to show our team to the Internet.

After that, we need to write C code and get a status badge.

During the whole process, we need to keep checking our tasks and pull requests.

Finally, we will promote our repo.
